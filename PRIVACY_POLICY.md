# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 20, 2024**

RecipeViewer ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect and How We Collect It

### a. User-Provided Information
RecipeViewer is designed as a local-first application. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal identification information (such as your name or email address) to use the app.

The only information you provide is:
- **Recipe URLs:** When you add a recipe via a URL, that URL is sent to the Google AI SDK (Gemini) to extract recipe content.
- **Recipe Data:** Any recipes you add, along with your progress (e.g., checked ingredients), are stored locally on your device.

### b. Automated Information Collection
The app does not use third-party tracking or analytics services.

## 2. Third-Party Services

### Google AI SDK (Gemini)
When you use the "Add Recipe" feature via a URL, the app sends the content of that URL to Google's Gemini AI services for processing. This processing is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and the terms of service for the Google AI SDK. We do not send your personal data to Google; only the publicly accessible URL you provide.

### External Website Links
When you provide a URL, the app fetches content from that third-party website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external sites.

## 3. Data Storage
All your recipe data, images (cached), and preferences are stored **locally on your device** using a Room database. This data is not uploaded to our servers. If you delete the app, this local data will be removed unless backed up by your system's standard Android backup service.

## 4. Permissions
The app may request the following permissions:
- **Internet Access:** Required to fetch recipe data from URLs and interact with the Gemini AI service.

## 5. Children's Privacy
Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 6. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
